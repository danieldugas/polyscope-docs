!!! note "Rolling Updates"

    As of July 2019, Polyscope is a recently-released library, we'll be frequently pushing updates and fixes directly to `master` as they come in. Once things settle down, hopefully within the next 6 months, we will switch to periodic versioned releases.




## Release notes

- **August 11, 2019** `dd4b36f`: Add curve network quantity.
- **July 20, 2019** `afe7c5e`: Add helpers for 2D visualization. Move templates on structure constructors for consistency.
- **July 18, 2019** `8514792`: Completely-rewritten Polyscope version 2.0 released. This new version is decoupled from any particular geometry codebase, and is designed to be easy to integrate with existing projects.
