### Dependencies

Polyscope packages all of its source code dependencies with the repository.

On Ubuntu and friends, you may want to `apt-get install xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev` to pull graphics and windowing related headers to build.

### Building in Windows

These instructions are unix-centric, because the project developers are mac and linux users. 

In theory, Polyscope builds just fine in Windows, though some manual effort may be required. Better instructions coming soon!
