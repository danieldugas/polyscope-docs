The core Polyscope C++ library is released under an [MIT license](https://github.com/nmwsharp/polyscope/blob/master/LICENSE), and all of its dependencies are under similar permissive licenses (MIT, zlib, or public domain).

These Python bindings are also released under an [MIT license](https://github.com/nmwsharp/polyscope-py/blob/master/LICENSE). The python bindings are generated using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11), which is under a BSD 3-clause license, and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), which is licensed under MPL2; again, these are permissive licenses.
