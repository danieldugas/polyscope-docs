The purpose of Polyscope is to serve the scientific and engineering community. Writing geomtric algorithms is _hard_, but maybe if visualization is simple we can make research and development a little bit easier. Please join us in this goal by pushing contributions back upstream to the repository, so everyone can benefit from your improvements.

Polyscope is created and maintained by academics: citations let us know our work is having impact! Please cite Polyscope or otherwise give a shout-out if and when it contributes to published works.
