## Bugs (or likely bugs)

- Make sure calling show() multiple times works as expected

- shutdown() is probably not something most users want...


## Needs to be resurrected

- restore intrinsic vector fields

- restore surface input functions

- resurrect subsets, add edges and faces


## Basic stuff to add

- ctrl-c ctrl-v for camera pose

- make sure we respect printPrefix


## Visual improvements

- dock menus to side

- pretty background

- some kind of solution for transparency

- SSAO?


## Short term features

- clean up surface_mesh.h and point_cloud.h

- update dependencies

- guard polyscope calls to do nothing if uninitialized

- corner data

## Long term features

- "sticky" parameters for options?
