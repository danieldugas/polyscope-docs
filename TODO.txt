## Bugs (or likely bugs)

- Make sure calling show() multiple times works as expected

- shutdown() is probably not something most users want...

- wtf is arcblob doing


## Needs to be resurrected

- restore surface input functions

- resurrect subsets, add edges and faces


## Basic stuff to add

- ctrl-c ctrl-v for camera pose

- make sure we respect printPrefix

- make sure all quantities return pointer to themself, suggest this paradigm

- for intrinsic surface vector fields:
  - add option to pass in 3D field and project it to tangent spaces
  - add option for interpreting nSym as power or representative


## Visual improvements

- pretty background

- some kind of solution for transparency

- SSAO?


## Short term features

- clean up surface_mesh.h and point_cloud.h

- update dependencies

- guard polyscope calls to do nothing if uninitialized

- templated functions to set mesh tangent spaces

- use enums for colormaps instead whatever integers are doing now
